Affine Transformation 07/03/17	

A --> SVD(A)= UDV'   U and V are othogonal vectors
V'V=1

UV'VDV'

UV' --> rotation matrix ; VDV' --> deformation matrix

MATLAB example

define the eigenvalues l1, l2
x21 etc lines at infinity

end MATLAB


Projective Transformation

MATLAB  example

Cross Ratio

MATLAB example

Action affinities and projectivites on point at infinity
affine
a11 a12 t1 | x1  =  a11 x1 + a12 x2 + 0
a21 a22 t2 | x2  =  a21 x1 + a22 x2 + 0
0    0  v  | 0   =  0 + 0 + 0

projective 
a11 a12 t1 | x1  =  same as affine
a21 a22 t2 | x2  =  same as affine
V1  V2  v  | 0   =  V1 x1 + V2 x2 + 0
