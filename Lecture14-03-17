2.7 Recovery


-Line at Infinity

Line and points behave differently, namely a point transform controvaraiantly and the line covariantly.

So whatever line at infinity won't change the fact that it lies on the infinity plain after that an affine transformation is appplied to it.

-Recovery from images

A vanishing point is a finite representation of a point at infinite. For example the projection of the infinite point on the image.

-Affine Rectification

	Ex	Computing a vanishing point from a length ratio.

	vp= H*[1;0] multiplication for a line at infinity
	Using the ratio among the world tiles and the tiles on the image to recover the affine transformation parameters.

To sum up:
	from aprojectively distorted image we find an homograpy that maps the image with an affine distortion.
	In projective representation a point at infinity is called a vanishing point and is projected on the image plane so it is no more at infinity.

-The circular points
	Every circle intersect the line at infinity at the circular points 	TAKE IT FOR GUARANTEED
	 visualized only in a Rhiemanian sphere space.

	 if we assume that any ellipse or circle intersect the line at infinity in two points, then we can compute the two pints with a single equation x1^2 + y1^2 =0 and find the two solutions ( 1, -i , 0 ) , ( 1 , i , 0).

-Conic dual to the circular points
